# Kicker - Premium sneakers store

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Personal project

I made this mock online store as a personal project. Feel free to use some/none of it in your own projects as you seem fit.

### Legal notice

No legal penalties are to be issued for using parts of my code, only for taking this project in its entirety and presenting it as your own.

## Technologies used

This project is built in React using styled components. I have used React's Context API for state management to avoid prop-drilling and share state across multiple parts of my app. For page manipulation, I have used React Router v6 routing library.

## Credits

Images are downloaded from Unsplash. Their respective authors are credited in data attributes in the markup and their unsplash handle is included as well. Other than that, they are included in a .txt files in folders where the images reside. Names of the sneakers were not on unsplash website so I had to find them online and assign them their proper names.
